title: PXF Upgrade and Migration
---
When you upgrade your Cloudberry Database system, you must perform some additional steps in order to bring your PXF configuration up to date.

There are three possible scenarios:

1. Upgrading PXF after [migrating from Cloudberry Database 5.x](migrate_5to6.html). If you were previously using the `gphdfs` external table protocol to access data stored in Hadoop, you must also [migrate your gphdfs external tables](gphdfs-pxf-migrate.html) to use PXF instead, since Cloudberry Database version 6 removes support for the `gphdfs` protocol.
1. Upgrading PXF after [upgrading Cloudberry Database from a previous 6.x version](upgrade_pxf_6x.html). Note that different steps are outlined based on your PXF installation source: a manually installed `rpm` or `deb` package downloaded from Tanzu Network, or the PXF version included with Cloudberry Database Server installer in versions 6.18.x and older. 
1. If you are upgrading a PXF `rpm` or `deb` installation independent of a Cloudberry Database upgrade, refer to the [PXF upgrade documentation](../../pxf/latest/upgrade_landing.html).
