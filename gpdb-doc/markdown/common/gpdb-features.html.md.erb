Source code for the Cloudberry Database documentation is shared between Cloudberry Database and
VMware Tanzu Cloudberry. Some features of Tanzu Cloudberry are not present in the
open source Cloudberry Database code but are described in the Cloudberry Database documentation. 

The term "Tanzu Cloudberry" refers to VMware's commercial, supported product offering that is 
based on open source Cloudberry Database.  "Tanzu Cloudberry" is used in this documentation when 
describing features that are available only in the commercial offering. The term "Cloudberry
Database" refers to features available in open source Cloudberry Database (and in the commercial Tanzu 
Cloudberry product). Commercial support for "Cloudberry Database" is offered by VMware as "Cloudberry Database by VMware Tanzu."

The following is a list of Tanzu Cloudberry features that are not provided or supported in open
source Cloudberry Database, but may be documented or referenced in this documentation.

- Code to produce the Tanzu Cloudberry binary installer packages is not included
in the open source Cloudberry Database repository. 

- Cloudberry Database does not include EMC DD Boost integration. Backing up to an EMC Data
Domain appliance is only supported when the Data Domain system is mounted as an NFS share on
the Cloudberry hosts. 

- Cloudberry Database does not include Symantec NetBackup integration. 

- The QuickLZ compression method is not available in Cloudberry Database. QuickLZ <codeph>compresstype</codeph> values are ignored when specified in a <codeph>CREATE TABLE
[AS]</codeph> operation, but will cause an error on subsequent <codeph>INSERT</codeph> or
<codeph>SELECT</codeph> operations on the table.

- The deprecated <codeph>gpcheck</codeph> management utility and its replacement <codeph>gpsupport</codeph> are only supported with Tanzu Cloudberry. 

- Suggestions to contact VMware Technical Support in this documentation are intended only for Tanzu Cloudberry customers. 

Source code for the following open source Cloudberry Database components are located in repositories outside of the Cloudberry Database repo:

- To use Backup and Restore with open source Cloudberry Database, you must separately build and install the backup/restore software.
